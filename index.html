                    <button class="faq-question">What is Blockchain?
                        <i class="bi bi-caret-right-fill toggle-icon"></i>
                    </button>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Blockchain is a special type of database that stores information securely and transparently. Instead of having one central authority controlling data, blockchain records information in "blocks" that are linked together in a chain. Each block contains a record of transactions, and once added, it cannot be changed. This makes blockchain highly secure and trustworthy. It is the technology behind cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, but it can also be used for secure voting, supply chain tracking, and digital contracts.</div>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <button class="faq-question">How does Blockchain work?
                        <i class="bi bi-caret-right-fill toggle-icon"></i>
                    </button>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Blockchain works by using a decentralized network of computers that verify and store transactions. When a new transaction happens, it is grouped with others into a block. This block is then checked by multiple computers (called nodes) in the network. If the majority agrees that the transaction is valid, the block is added to the chain permanently. This process makes blockchain highly secure because no single person or company controls the data, and it is nearly impossible to alter past records.</div>

                    </button>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Blockchain is secure because of its decentralized nature and cryptographic protection. Since data is stored across many computers instead of a single server, it is difficult for hackers to alter or delete information. Every block contains a unique digital fingerprint (called a hash) and is linked to the previous block. If someone tries to change one block, they would have to change every block in the chain, which is practically impossible. This makes blockchain one of the safest ways to store and transfer data.</div>

                    </button>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, are digital currencies that use blockchain technology to operate. Instead of relying on banks, cryptocurrencies use a decentralized blockchain network to record transactions securely. When you send Bitcoin to someone, the transaction is verified by the blockchain and recorded permanently. Because of blockchain, cryptocurrencies are transparent, fast, and secure, allowing people to send money globally without needing a bank or financial institution.</div>
